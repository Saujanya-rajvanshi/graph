## 🔷 Types of Graphs (Data Structures)

### 🔹 1. Based on Direction

* **Undirected Graph** – edges have no direction
* **Directed Graph (Digraph)** – edges have direction

---

### 🔹 2. Based on Weights

* **Weighted Graph** – edges have weights
* **Unweighted Graph** – edges have no weights

---

### 🔹 3. Based on Connectivity

* **Connected Graph** – path exists between every pair of vertices
* **Disconnected Graph** – at least one vertex is unreachable

---

### 🔹 4. Based on Cycles

* **Cyclic Graph** – contains at least one cycle
* **Acyclic Graph** – no cycles

---

### 🔹 5. Special Graph Types

* **Complete Graph** – edge between every pair of vertices
* **Null Graph** – no edges
* **Regular Graph** – all vertices have same degree
* **Bipartite Graph** – vertices divided into two sets
* **Complete Bipartite Graph** – every vertex of one set connects to all in other
* **Multigraph** – multiple edges allowed
* **Pseudograph** – self-loops allowed

---

### 🔹 6. Tree-Based Graphs

* **Tree** – connected, acyclic graph
* **Forest** – collection of trees

---

### 🔹 7. Directed Special Graphs

* **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** – no cycles (used in scheduling)
---

## graph representation

#### 1. Adjacency matrix representation 
* graph represented in a form of matrix of size v*v
* filled with either 1 or 0

#### 2. Adjacency list representation 
* every vertex of a graph contains list of its adjacent vertices 
* space complexity O(|V|+|E|)

### Interview Summary Line
Adjacency Matrix is preferred for dense graphs due to O(1) edge lookup, while Adjacency List is preferred for sparse graphs because of lower space usage.


## graph traversal 
* start from one vertex and go along the edges to visit other vertices untill all vertices.
* decide the order of vertices
* traverse without getting into looping

### TWO GRAPH TRAVERSAL TECHNIQUES
* **DFS**(DEPTH FIRST SEARCH) - [DFS](#DFS)
* **BFS**(BREADTH FIRST SEARCH)  - [BFS](#BFS)

## DFS
---

## 🔍 DFS (Depth First Search)

🔹 **Data Structure Used**: **Stack**
🔹 **Maximum Stack Size**: Total number of vertices in the graph

---

## 🪜 Steps to Implement DFS Traversal

**Step 1️⃣**
📦 Define a **stack** of size equal to the total number of vertices in the graph.

**Step 2️⃣**
▶️ Select **any vertex** as the starting point.
👀 Visit that vertex and **push it onto the stack**.

**Step 3️⃣**
🔗 From the vertex at the **top of the stack**, visit **any one non-visited adjacent vertex** and **push it onto the stack**.

**Step 4️⃣**
🔁 Repeat **Step 3** until there is **no new adjacent vertex** to visit from the vertex at the top of the stack.

**Step 5️⃣**
↩️ If no new vertex is found, perform **backtracking** by **popping one vertex** from the stack.

**Step 6️⃣**
🔄 Repeat **Steps 3, 4, and 5** until the **stack becomes empty**.

**Step 7️⃣**
✅ When the stack is empty, DFS traversal is complete and the **final spanning tree** is obtained.

✔️ DFS explores **depth first**
✔️ Uses **stack (explicit or recursion)**
✔️ Involves **backtracking**


### DFS Traversal (Worked Example)

### 🔹 Given

* **Graph vertices**: `A B C D E F G`
* **Traversal technique**: **DFS (Depth First Search)**
* **Data Structure used**: **Stack**
* **Auxiliary arrays**:

  * `status[]` → visited / not visited
  * `output[]` → traversal order

---

## 🔹 Initial Setup

1. **Status Array**

```
A B C D E F G
0 0 0 0 0 0 0   (0 = not visited, 1 = visited)
```

2. **Stack size** = number of vertices = **7**

3. **Output** → empty initially

---

## 🔹 Step-by-Step DFS Traversal

### 🟢 Step 1: Start from vertex **A**

* Visit `A`
* Push `A` into stack

```
Stack: A
Output: A
Status: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

---

### 🟢 Step 2: Visit unvisited adjacent of **A**

* Choose `B`
* Push `B`

```
Stack: B A
Output: A B
Status: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0
```

---

### 🟢 Step 3: Visit unvisited adjacent of **B**

* Choose `C`
* Push `C`

```
Stack: C B A
Output: A B C
Status: 1 1 1 0 0 0 0
```

---

### 🟢 Step 4: Visit unvisited adjacent of **C**

* Choose `E`
* Push `E`

```
Stack: E C B A
Output: A B C E
Status: 1 1 1 0 1 0 0
```

---

### 🟢 Step 5: Visit unvisited adjacent of **E**

* Choose `D`
* Push `D`

```
Stack: D E C B A
Output: A B C E D
Status: 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
```

---

### 🔁 Backtracking Begins

* `D` has no unvisited adjacent → **pop**
* From `E`, visit `F`

```
Stack: F E C B A
Output: A B C E D F
Status: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0
```

---

### 🔁 Continue Backtracking

* From `F`, visit `G`

```
Stack: G F E C B A
Output: A B C E D F G
Status: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

---

## ✅ Final DFS Traversal Order

```
A → B → C → E → D → F → G
```

---

## ⭐ Key Observations (Exam / Interview)

* DFS uses **Stack**
* Goes **deep before wide**
* Uses **backtracking**
* Time Complexity: **O(V + E)**
* Space Complexity: **O(V)**

✔️ **Same graph in BFS**
✔️ **Dry run table (stack | status | output)**
✔️ **C++ DFS code (recursive + stack)**
